# EgSA_TLM

## Introduction
This project is assigned to each group judging by the specialization and interest. For my case, we were assigned to a project titled “Satellite Receiver Telemetry Data Module”, which is based on the telemetry subsystem that is responsible for sending commands from the ground segment and receiving and monitoring the satellite’s telemetry and states in the space. By the end of this project, we managed to implement a software program that is successfully functioning and integrated with another group that represents the space side of the process. 

The telemetry Control System is one of the most important systems in the ground control station. It’s responsible for sending commands like Imaging to the satellite and receiving telemetry data satellite sensors which indicate the status of the satellite like pressure or temperature and also the data of the task that the satellite is responsible for like the Imaging command.
The system contains two main subsystems:
1.	TLM server: Which receive the commands to the satellite
2.	TLM Client: Which shows the data from the satellite

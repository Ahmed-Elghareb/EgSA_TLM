# EgSA_TLM

## Introduction
This project is assigned to each group judging by the specialization and interest. For my case, we were assigned to a project titled “Satellite Receiver Telemetry Data Module”, which is based on the telemetry subsystem that is responsible for sending commands from the ground segment and receiving and monitoring the satellite’s telemetry and states in the space. By the end of this project, we managed to implement a software program that is successfully functioning and integrated with another group that represents the space side of the process.
